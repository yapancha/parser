Recursive Descent Parser

This project is a parser created for a madeup language. 


- The following keywords are defined:
    ○ int
    
    ○ string
    
    ○ set
    
    ○ print
    
    ○ println
    
- There are four operators:
    ○ +
    
    ○ -
    
    ○ *
    
    ○ /
    
    
- Grammar rules:
   Prog ::= StmtList
   StmtList ::= { Stmt T_SC } { StmtList }
   Stmt ::= Decl | Set | Print
   Decl ::= T_INT T_ID | T_STRING T_ID
   Set ::= T_SET T_ID Expr
   Print ::= T_PRINT Expr | T_PRINTLN Expr
   Expr ::= Term { (T_PLUS|T_MINUS) Expr }
   Term ::= Primary { (T_STAR|T_SLASH) Term }
   Primary ::= T_ICONST | T_SCONST | T_ID | T_LPAREN Expr T_RPAREN

- Semantic rules:

    1. There are only two types: integer and string.
    2. Variables must be declared before they are used. They are declared with Decl.
    3. There is one single scope for variables.
    4. Variable names must be unique; once a name has been declared, it may not be
       declared again.
    5. An integer constant is of type integer.
    6. A string constant is of type string.
    7. The type of an identifier is the type assigned when it is declared.
    8. The type of an Expr or a Term is the type of the result of the operation.
    9. Adding two integers results in an integer representing the sum
    10. Subtracting two integers results in an integer representing the difference
    11. Multiplying two integers results in an integer representing the product
    12. Dividing two integers results in an integer representing the quotient
    13. Adding two strings results in a string representing the concatenation
    14. Multiplying an integer by a string results in a string which is the string operand repeated
        integer times (i.e. 3 * “hi” is “hihihi”)
    15. Dividing two strings results in an a string where the first instance of the denominator that
        is found in the numerator is removed.
    16. ALL OTHER COMBINATIONS OF OPERATIONS ARE UNDEFINED and are an error
    17. A variable is assigned a value using a Set. The type of the variable being set must match
        the type of the expression; if it does not this is an error.
    18. An expression can be printed using either “print” or “println”. In both cases, the value of
        the Expr is printed to the standard output. In the case of “println”, a newline is printed to
        standard out at the end of the execution of the program
